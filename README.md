#NASA API
1. Is it well-documented?
It is simply documented, which is not bad. It is pretty easy to understand once you get the navigation down. 

2. Is it well-supported?
It is well supported. We were able to hit it on postman, so that is pretty helpful. 

3. Is it widely used? (Things you might check: GitHub stars/watchers, search engine results, recent updates)


4. Is it intuitive to use?
Kind of, I think it is more of...you need to know what you are looking for in order to get the most out of it. There's not really any instructions on what the API is returning back

5. What is the most interesting/exciting thing you discovered about the service?


6. What could be improved?
An explaination of what they mean by "start" and "end" date would have been helpful.
