#NASA API
1. Is it well-documented?
It is simply documented, which is not bad. It is pretty easy to understand once you get the navigation down. There are a lot more routes on it, which they don't really advertise that. There is not a whole lot really explained on it. 

2. Is it well-supported?
It is well supported. We were able to hit it on postman, so that is pretty helpful. 

3. Is it widely used? (Things you might check: GitHub stars/watchers, search engine results, recent updates)
It doesn't look like it is widely used, the github that manages it has 2-6 views and stars here and there. If you google it, you dont get the right stuff popping up. 

4. Is it intuitive to use?
Kind of, I think it is more of...you need to know what you are looking for in order to get the most out of it. There's not really any instructions on what the API is returning back

5. What is the most interesting/exciting thing you discovered about the service?
That this idea seems cool in theory and it is from NASA, but not maintained nearly as much as I thought it would be...is what I found interesting. 

6. What could be improved?
An explaination of what they mean by "start" and "end" date would have been helpful.




#Twilio API
1. Is it well-documented?
It is well documented. The docs are straight forward and pretty easy to follow. 

2. Is it well-supported?
It is well supported. Easy to hit too. 

3. Is it widely used? (Things you might check: GitHub stars/watchers, search engine results, recent updates)
It does look like it is widely use, the correct link comes up in the searches. 

4. Is it intuitive to use?
Kind of, the issue we ran into was figuring out the phone-number stuff. 

5. What is the most interesting/exciting thing you discovered about the service?
It was fun to figure out how to get both of these things working together

6. What could be improved?
A bit more of an explanation on the phone number trial would've been helpful
